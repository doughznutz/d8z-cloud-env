Add a JSON-RPC endpoint for MCP commands (initialize, executeCommand, etc.).

Add SSE streaming for responses:

from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
import json, asyncio

app = FastAPI()

async def event_stream():
    while True:
        message = json.dumps({"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": "pong", "id": 1})
        yield f"data: {message}\n\n"
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

@app.get("/mcp/stream")
async def stream(request: Request):
    return StreamingResponse(event_stream(), media_type="text/event-stream")


VSCode will then successfully connect via SSE.

This is required for the official continue.continue MCP client.

Yes — there are a few considerations beyond just exposing your MCP server over HTTP/SSE for VSCode. Gemini CLI and Claude (or other LLM agents) have some **protocol and environment expectations**. Let’s break it down carefully.

---

## 1. **Gemini CLI**

* **Runs MCP subprocess locally**

  * Typically expects `gcloud-mcp` or another MCP to run as a **local subprocess**.
  * You **cannot run the official MCP in a separate container** unless you wrap it with a JSON-RPC + SSE interface.

* **Requirements for your custom MCP server**:

  1. Implement **MCP JSON-RPC methods**:

     * `initialize`, `executeCommand`, `shutdown`, `getSchema`, etc.
  2. Support **SSE streaming** for agent messages (`text/event-stream`).
  3. Ensure **agent authentication / credentials** are handled by MCP — Gemini CLI should not require cloud credentials itself.
  4. Optional: implement **dynamic port discovery** if multiple Gemini CLI instances may run on the same host.

* **Environment variables**:

  * Your MCP server may need `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` for GCP access.
  * Agents may need `MCP_SERVER_URL` pointing to your SSE endpoint if not running as subprocess.

---

## 2. **Claude or other LLM agents**

* Most LLM agents (Claude, Anthropic, etc.) **do not directly implement MCP** — they connect to MCP-like servers via a **JSON-RPC or REST API**.
* To integrate:

  1. Ensure your MCP **exposes JSON-RPC endpoints** that map agent commands (`executeCommand`, `getSchema`).
  2. Wrap any streaming or multi-step agent responses in **SSE or WebSocket** if the agent expects streaming updates.
  3. Ensure **agent identity/session** is tracked if multiple agents connect to the same MCP.

## 3. **Other general changes / considerations**

| Feature     | Gemini CLI                                   | Claude / LLM                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Connection  | Local subprocess (preferred) or SSE/JSON-RPC | SSE/JSON-RPC or WebSocket                         |
| Auth        | MCP holds GCP credentials                    | MCP holds GCP credentials                         |
| Streaming   | SSE required for real-time feedback          | Optional; recommended for long-running operations |
| Multi-agent | MCP must handle multiple connections         | MCP must handle multiple connections              |
| Logging     | Push logs to MCP or GCS                      | Push logs to MCP or GCS                           |
| Commands    | Full JSON-RPC spec                           | Only commands supported by MCP API                |

### ✅ Summary

1. **For Gemini CLI:**

   * MCP must implement JSON-RPC + SSE if running separately.
   * Credentials must be handled by the MCP.
   * Optional: allow dynamic port assignment for multiple clients.

2. **For Claude / LLM agents:**

   * MCP must expose JSON-RPC endpoints compatible with agent commands.
   * Streaming (SSE or WebSocket) is highly recommended.
   * Track sessions if multiple agents are using the same MCP server.

---

If you want, I can **update your `mcp_server.py` scaffold** to support:

* SSE streaming for both VSCode and agent clients
* JSON-RPC endpoints for `executeCommand` / `initialize` / logging
* Multi-agent session handling

This would make your MCP **fully compatible with Gemini CLI, VSCode, and future LLM agents like Claude**.
