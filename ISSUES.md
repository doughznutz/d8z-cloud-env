## Issues
### d8z-cloud-env Startup complicated
#### Should be one command to get from any docker commandline to debugging a project.

### d8z-cloud-env Logging complicated
#### Database is overkill  All should go into /home/$USER or /var/logs via mountpoint.

### d8z-cloud-env User missing or unclear.
#### Gemini service doesnt have a user and writes files as root.
#### Need a solid solution for USER permissions on mounted files used outside container.
